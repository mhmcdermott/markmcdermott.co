# Retrospective Task Breakdown

## What would have been auto-generated from PRD:

### Phase 1: Security Audit (High Priority)
- [ ] Run npm audit to identify vulnerabilities
- [ ] Fix critical vulnerabilities first
- [ ] Update all dependencies to latest stable versions
- [ ] Document any breaking changes

### Phase 2: Security Headers (High Priority)
- [ ] Research recommended security headers for Next.js
- [ ] Implement headers in next.config.mjs
- [ ] Test headers with security tools
- [ ] Verify no impact on functionality

### Phase 3: API Security (High Priority)
- [ ] Audit all API routes for security issues
- [ ] Implement input validation on contact form
- [ ] Add XSS protection via sanitization
- [ ] Add rate limiting considerations
- [ ] Improve error handling
- [ ] Review logging for privacy concerns

### Phase 4: Testing & Verification (Medium Priority)
- [ ] Run TypeScript compiler
- [ ] Run ESLint
- [ ] Execute production build
- [ ] Verify all SEO features still work
- [ ] Test contact form with various inputs
- [ ] Check RSS feed functionality

### Phase 5: Documentation (Low Priority)
- [ ] Document security changes
- [ ] Update deployment checklist
- [ ] Create API security guidelines

## How the MCP workflow would have executed:

1. **Notion MCP**: Created PRD in Geek Projects database
2. **Taskmaster MCP**: Generated above tasks from PRD
3. **Context7 MCP**: Enhanced tasks with technical details and commands
4. **Linear MCP**: Created issues with proper labeling and assignment
5. **Background Agents**: Executed security scans and automated fixes
6. **Playwright MCP**: Would have tested form validation and API endpoints
7. **GitHub MCP**: Created feature branch, committed changes
8. **Slack MCP**: Sent progress updates at each phase completion

## Automation Benefits Demonstrated:
- Automatic task breakdown from high-level PRD
- Parallel execution of independent tasks
- Continuous testing during development
- Real-time progress tracking
- Automated documentation generation
