# Project Planning with Claude Code & MCP (9 Servers)

## 🎯 Overview

A comprehensive methodology for planning and executing software projects using Claude Code enhanced with 9 Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers. This approach combines AI-powered analysis, structured documentation, and automated workflows to create a seamless development experience from planning to production.

### Why This Approach Works
- **AI-Enhanced Planning** - Claude Code provides intelligent project analysis and recommendations
- **Integrated Toolchain** - 9 MCP servers work together for comprehensive project management
- **Documentation-Driven** - Clear PRDs and structured planning reduce ambiguity
- **End-to-End Coverage** - From planning through production monitoring
- **Automated Workflows** - Reduces manual overhead and improves consistency

### ⚠️ **Important: MCP Server Reliability Notice**
Not all MCP servers in the ecosystem are stable or production-ready. Some may require workarounds, alternative configurations, or may need to be temporarily disabled if experiencing issues. This guide provides the ideal workflow when all servers are functioning, but includes troubleshooting notes for common server problems.

## 🔧 MCP Server Troubleshooting Guide

### Server Status Quick Reference

#### ✅ **Stable Servers** (Always work)
- **GitHub MCP**: Full repository management
- **Linear MCP**: Complete issue tracking  
- **Notion MCP**: Documentation and data backend

#### ⚠️ **Requires Configuration** (Work with proper setup)
- **Slack MCP**: Needs valid bot token and team ID
- **Vercel MCP**: Needs valid API token
- **PostHog MCP**: Needs valid project API key
- **Context7 MCP**: Functions may not register properly
- **Playwright MCP**: Needs browser installation (`npx playwright install`)

#### ❌ **Problematic Servers** (May need alternatives)
- **Task Master MCP**: Connection stability issues
- **Supabase MCP**: Removed due to broken argument parsing

### Common Issues & Solutions

#### **Server Functions Not Appearing**
**Problem**: MCP server is running but Claude Code doesn't see its functions
**Solutions**:
1. Restart Claude Code completely (Cmd+Q then relaunch)
2. Check server logs in Activity Monitor for crash loops
3. Remove server from config, restart Claude Code, re-add server
4. Verify API tokens are current and have correct permissions

#### **Authentication Failures**
**Problem**: "401 Unauthorized" or "Invalid token" errors
**Solutions**:
1. **Slack**: Regenerate bot token in Slack app settings
2. **Vercel**: Check API token permissions in Vercel dashboard
3. **PostHog**: Verify project API key in PostHog settings
4. **GitHub**: Ensure token has repo access permissions

#### **Connection Timeouts**
**Problem**: Servers start but don't respond or crash frequently  
**Solutions**:
1. **Task Master**: Consider disabling if unstable
2. **Context7**: Use manual documentation lookup as backup
3. **Playwright**: Install browsers: `npx playwright install`

### Minimal Working Setup

If multiple servers are failing, start with this minimal configuration:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "notion": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["@suekou/mcp-notion-server"],
      "env": {
        "NOTION_API_TOKEN": "your_token_here"
      }
    },
    "github": {
      "command": "npx", 
      "args": ["@modelcontextprotocol/server-github"],
      "env": {
        "GITHUB_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN": "your_token_here"
      }
    },
    "linear": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["mcp-remote", "https://mcp.linear.app/sse"],
      "env": {
        "LINEAR_API_KEY": "your_key_here"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Then add other servers one by one after verifying each works.

### Fallback Strategies

#### **When Task Master is Down**
- Use Claude Code directly for task breakdown
- Create tasks manually in Linear  
- Use Notion for project planning documents

#### **When Context7 is Down**
- Search documentation manually
- Use web search within Claude Code
- Bookmark commonly referenced docs

#### **When Analytics Servers Fail**
- Use platform native dashboards (Vercel dashboard, PostHog web interface)
- Set up manual reporting processes
- Focus on core development workflow

### Recovery Process

1. **Identify failing servers** - Check which functions are missing
2. **Isolate the issue** - Test each server package individually  
3. **Fix authentication** - Update expired or invalid tokens
4. **Clean restart** - Remove all servers, add back working ones first
5. **Document workarounds** - Note which servers need manual alternatives
6. **Monitor stability** - Watch for recurring failures over time

Remember: **The workflow works with just GitHub, Linear, and Notion**. Additional servers enhance the experience but aren't required for core productivity.
